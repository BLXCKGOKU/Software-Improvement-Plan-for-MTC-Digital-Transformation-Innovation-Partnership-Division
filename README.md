For our SPS611S assignment, we were tasked with analyzing an existing software development process within a Namibian organization, identifying areas for improvement, and developing a Software Process Improvement Plan. 
This involved conducting interviews, surveys, or observations to assess the organization's current software development practices, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and bottlenecks, and proposing improvements.
Our group collaborated with the MTC Digital Transformation, Innovation, and Partnership Division at the NUST HTTPS building. 
This division extends beyond MTCâ€™s internal needs, working with partners like the Bank of Namibia and City of Windhoek to deliver customized software solutions for both internal and external clients.
Based on our analysis, we developed an improvement plan that included process changes, tool adoption, and team restructuring to enhance software development efficiency. 
We compiled our findings into a detailed report, outlining the analysis, proposed improvements, implementation plan, and expected outcomes. Finally, we presented our recommendations to stakeholders, showcasing how our plan could enhance software development within the organization.
